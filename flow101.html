                        <strong>Introduction to Mobirise</strong></h3>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">If you didn't already know, the name of the no code
                        builder is Mobirise. Think of it like building a house, with each block and building materials.
                        You can arrange each material anyhow and get different buildings, that's kind of how Mobirise
                        works. There are different elements on Mobirise and then it's left for you to piece each element
                        together to form a webpage.<br><br>It's hardly enough to make a decent website by just dragging
                        and dropping elements to your canvas. That's the difference between a regular website and a
                        professional website. To build modern standard websites there are steps you would have to follow
                        to get that professional touch on your sites and that's what we would be talking about in the
                        coming lessons.<br><br></p>

                        <strong>What can you build?</strong></h3>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Using the Mobirise Software you can build a variety of
                        STATIC websites. What's a static website you might ask? A static website is a website primarily
                        built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and generally lacks a backend. In essence the content of a
                        static website remains the same for all users that opens the site. This opposes to a Dynamic
                        Website in which the content of a page may vary with user. A dynamic website employs things like
                        a database, authentication and servers.&nbsp;<br><br>Focusing on Mobirise, you can have certain
                        backend features, most of which requires a one time payment to obtain but you have a free form
                        element where users can send information back to you. With the software, you can
                        build:&nbsp;<br><br></p>

                        <strong>Website Components</strong></h3>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">As we have established, the website builder uses drag
                        and drop technology to make webpages, the things that you drag and drop are called
                        <em>blocks</em>. We shall discuss all the various groups of components that a webpage can
                        ideally have with this software:<br></p>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
                <div class="counter-container col-md-12 col-lg-10">

                    <div class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Menu:&nbsp;</strong>The menu element is ideally meant to be put at the top part
                                of the webpage, it contains the menu of the website and the hamburger. Do note that you
                                can only have one menu per page and menu is a universal component which means when you
                                drag it to your canvas, it will appear on every page and when you delete it, you can opt
                                to delete for all pages in one click.</li>
                            <li><strong>Header:&nbsp;</strong>Contrary to what you might have in mind, the header
                                element isn't quite labelled header in the code. The header is simply a group of blocks
                                that is meant to highlight the central idea of the page.</li>
                            <li><strong>&nbsp;Features: </strong>The features element contains blocks that are mainly
                                used to showcase certain important concepts of the brand you're working with. Things
                                like mission, vision, policies, principles and even best seller items!</li>
                            <li><strong style="font-size: calc(1.14rem + 0.26 * ((100vw - 62rem) / 25));">Articles:
                                </strong><span style="font-size: calc(1.14rem + 0.26 * ((100vw - 62rem) / 25));">This is
                                    just as the element name implies, it contains blocks for content writing with some
                                    having the option to combine images with texts. The article blocks usually have
                                    heading, subtitles and then main texts.</span></li>
                            <li><strong>Image &amp; Video: </strong>What's a website without media? Adding pictures and
                                videos to your webpage not only have a way of maintaining users interest but it just
                                makes the brand more legit. Which is why there's free customization of images and video
                                looks.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gallery &amp; Slider: </strong>Very similar to images but this element contains
                                blocks with very unique image presentation abilities such as pop up sliders which makes
                                the image pop out to a full screen version, automatic scrolling of pictures using embla
                                JS, mansory grid etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>People: </strong>This serves two main functions, sometimes you may design a site
                                for a company and this company may want to show some key important personnel in the
                                business. Or maybe you're designing a site for a brand or company and they have
                                testimonials of people who used their service, you may add such using people blocks.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Contact: </strong>Using Google Map API, you can integrate Google maps seamlessly
                                to your website by simply typing the address of the client and you can have a Google map
                                pointer to the location</li>
                            <li><strong>Social: </strong>Brand awareness transcends having a website, with the
                                recognition of this, we have a set of blocks that will urge the users to check out and
                                follow the social media presence of your brand or company.</li>
                            <li><strong>Form:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;It's best practice to have a way for users to contact
                                the brand owners and with that in mind, we designed something called <em>formoid</em>,
                                when users fill a form from any block on the website you can add an email address that
                                the responses will automatically get sent to. Although you can get a personalized
                                response unit for the client which would contain the logo and style of the brand which
                                we would build for you at a very cheap rate.</li>
                            <li><strong>Footer: </strong>Footers are used to represent the end of the page as well as
                                some useful stuff about the brand such as their legal terms, social media links,
                                copyright information etc. Just like the menu block, footer blocks are also universal
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>List: </strong>The list element contains blocks that you can use for numerating
                                and listing things, remember <a href="HTML104.html#article12-54"
                                    class="text-primary">list tag</a> in HTML? That's what is used in building the
                                lists. The FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) however aren't built with lists and FAQs
                                help users to have quick answers to likely questions about the company.</li>
                            <li><strong>Number: </strong>Does the brand need a countdown timer? Or need to have a step
                                by step guide to do something? You can now easily drag any number block and modify as
                                needed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pricing: </strong>May not be applicable to all use cases, but majority of the
                                sites you'll make may need pricing for services they offer or just the price of one or
                                more items on the website. You may achieve this using the pricing block.</li>
                            <li><strong>News: </strong>While building a blog site for your client you'll need to make
                                use of this! But the news block can also be used to add small blog pages for the brands
                                than may have or need.&nbsp;</li>
